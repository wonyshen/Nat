     <h1>About</h1>
     <p>Hi there! My name is Natthan and I am currently a student at BCIT's Marketing Management program. My area of focus is entrepreneurship, and I am always looking for ways to use my skills and knowledge to solve business problems. In addition to my studies, I have also gained a lot of experience working with startups over the past 5 years. This has given me a deep understanding of the unique needs and processes involved in working in the startup world. <br><br>
        As a graphic designer, I am driven by my passion for creating visually appealing and effective designs that communicate ideas and messages effectively. I have a diverse range of design experience, including branding, logo design, and print and digital media. I am always looking for ways to push my creative boundaries and to learn new skills that will help me to excel in my field. <br><br>  
        I am excited to share my portfolio with you and hope that you enjoy browsing through my work. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you for visiting!</p>
